# PZ-Video-Shader
A set of shader effects for a VRC video player screen made in Amplify Shader Editor. Still in early development. 

- Emissive gamma controls so you are not stuck with a single emissive value like the default VRC shader

- Pixelation effect

- Posterization effect [Basically reduces the number of colors that can be used and creates an interesting effect]

- Grayscale effect

If you like this shader please consider donating to help me keep creating free prefabs and shaders for the VRC community! :D

If you have any questions, find any bugs, etc let me know at The Party Zone discord! I am happy to take suggestions for future effects too!
